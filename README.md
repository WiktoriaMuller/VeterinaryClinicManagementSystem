# Veterinary Clinic Management System

## Overview
This repository contains a **low‐code application** built in **Retool** for managing veterinary patients, visits and medical history. It uses **PostgreSQL** to store data, with **SQL CRUD** operations to handle patients, veterinarians and pet owners. It also **integrates with a REST API** to automatically send appointment confirmation emails, streamlining the clinic’s workflow. The project includes database diagrams, screenshots of the application and the complete Toolscript ZIP export from Retool.

## Contents
* **Diagrams** folder contains two main diagrams that illustrate different aspects of the system. The first is a flowchart that shows the process for creating and managing appointments from start to finish. It demonstrates how a clinic employee adds new records if needed, saves and edits visit details. The second is an ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram), which shows how the **visits, pets, vets**, and **owners** tables connect through primary and foreign keys to organize and link data across the application.
* **Screenshots** folder contains images of the application interface, including the main pages and the various forms for adding new visits, pets or employees. They demonstrate how appointments are listed, how records are displayed, and which actions can be performed throughout the system.
* **Toolscript ZIP Export** includes all files generated by the “Export to Toolscript ZIP” feature in Retool, providing the full structure and configuration of the app, such as JSON files for layout and settings, RSX files representing the different pages and components of the app, and SQL files used to query and manipulate data.

## Usage
1. Clone or Download this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the diagrams folder to understand the workflow and database structure.
3. Review the screenshots folder to see how the application looks in action.
4. Check the ZIP folder to view or modify the Toolscript ZIP export from Retool. If needed, you can re-import this folder back into a Retool environment to recreate or customize the application.
